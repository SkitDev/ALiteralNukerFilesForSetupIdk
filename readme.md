<h1 align="center">ALN Setup Files</h1>
<h3 align="center">💻 Assets, Payloads, and Ignorance 💀</h3>

---

### ⚠️ Heads up

This repo wasn't meant to be seen directly — it's just used by the ALiteralNuker installer to download:

- Core payloads
- Presets, logs, assets, and more
- The files I was too lazy to bundle 😭

---

### 📦 Contents

- `ALiteralNuker.zip` → Main payload installed by the setup
- `assets/` → Icons, images, visuals
- `presets/`, `logs/`, `statistics/` → Runtime folders
- `proxies.txt` → you already know why

---

### ❌ Don't clone this  
The installer handles all that — unless you're tryna break it or poke around.

---

> Made for ALN — the installer knows what to do 🥀
